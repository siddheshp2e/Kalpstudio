# How can I test my Smart Contract?

This guide empowers you to leverage Kalp Studio for efficient smart contract deployment and streamlined testing. Discover how to seamlessly deploy your smart contracts and effectively test them.

### 

Smart Contract Verification and Testing

**Step 1:** Verify your smart contract's syntax and functionality by compiling it using the following command:

Copy

```
$ go build .
```

**Step 2:** A successful compilation signifies that your code adheres to Go language syntax rules and is free of errors.

**Step 3:** Proceed to test your smart contract to ensure its behavior aligns with your expectations. Utilize appropriate testing frameworks or unit tests to simulate interactions with your smart contract and verify its outputs. This step is crucial for identifying and rectifying any potential issues before deployment.

### 

Interacting with Your Smart Contract

1.  Establish a connection to the relevant blockchain network, enabling your application to interact with the deployed smart contracts.
    
2.  Kalp Studio automatically generates API endpoints that directly map to the functionalities of your smart contracts. These endpoints simplify integration by providing a well-defined interface for your front-end application to interact with the underlying smart contract logic.

**Steps to Deploy and test the smart contract API endpoints:**

-   **Deployment of Smart Contract through Kalp Studio:** Utilize the **generated API endpoints** directly within your front-end application (e.g., React.js, Next.js). This approach seamlessly integrates smart contract functionalities into your user interface, enabling dynamic interactions and data retrieval.

-   **Checking and Testing API Endpoints:** Employ **Postman**, a popular API testing tool, to send requests to the generated API endpoints. This method facilitates individual function testing, allowing you to verify their behavior and outputs in a controlled environment before integrating them into your front-end application.

Postman Testing for Kalp Smart Contract API Endpoints

Following successful smart contract deployment and API endpoint generation within Kalp Studio, delve into the essential steps for testing these endpoints using Postman:

1.  **Reading from the Smart Contract**
    

Kalp Studio enables efficient data retrieval from deployed smart contracts using **read-only methods**. These methods allow your application to query the blockchain ledger without modifying its state.

**Example:** To retrieve a user's account balance, you would invoke the `ClientAccountBalance` function through the generated API endpoint. This function would fetch the relevant data from the ledger and return it to your application.

By leveraging read-only methods, you can access crucial information from the blockchain without altering its state, ensuring data integrity and facilitating various application functionalities.

Sample Result: ClientAccountBalance Function

1.  **Writing to the Smart Contract**
    

Kalp Studio empowers developers to perform **write operations**, which involve modifying the state of the blockchain ledger through smart contract interactions. These operations typically involve sending transactions to specific contract functions provided by the Kalp SDK.

**Example:** To transfer tokens, you would utilize the appropriate function (e.g., `Transfer`) through the generated API endpoint. This function would initiate a transaction on the blockchain, deducting tokens from the sender's account and crediting them to the recipient's account.

Sample Result: MintBatch Function

1.  **Transaction Management:** With the Kalp SDK, developers can efficiently manage transactions on the blockchain network. It provides functions for submitting transactions, querying transaction information, and retrieving transaction history. This simplifies the process of interacting with the blockchain and ensures the integrity of transactional operations.
    

**Example:** All the Functions provided as: `PutStateWithKYC, DelStateWithoutKYC, DelStateWithKYC, GetState, GetTxID, GetChannelD, SetEvent, GetUserID.`
