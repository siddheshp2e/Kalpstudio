# Kalp Studio: How can I view the list of my Smart Contracts ?

Hey Users! Welcome to the Kalp Studio Platform.

Keeping track of your smart contracts can feel overwhelming, but it doesn't have to be. Kalp Studio is here to simplify your experience, offering a streamlined and efficient way to view and manage all your smart contracts in one place.

> Smart contracts are automated contracts coded on a blockchain, facilitating secure, transparent, and decentralized transactions without intermediaries. They execute or enforce contract terms when certain conditions are met.

Let's dive into how you can view your list of smart contracts on Kalp Studio.

**1. Smart Contract**

![Figure 1: Dashboard](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060007018960%2Foriginal%2FtIYz3pZLxhLqCvW6ynUIVFbNkSV0xufaYg.png%3F1708503373&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=046d8d863b4e0dfc60326c79eea48516fbd69c8d8dd92c2239e10fb16cbcfc67)



Go to the smart contract section on the left menu.

Once there, you'll see a list of smart contracts. Each entry in this list is composed of several components:

![Figure 2: Smart Contract List](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060007019273%2Foriginal%2F4_020P0oVVlgL2VF5QWv0mpSFI36lRHj3A.png%3F1708503670&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=ada3919e59b6ccbc9ae820cb717b765aeb72aff306d1043200bf57b28501a823)



-   **ID:** A unique identifier for the smart contract.
    
-   **Name:** The name given to the smart contract.
    
-   **Project:** The project or initiative the smart contract is part of.
    
-   **Environment:** The development or deployment environment of the smart contract
    
-   **Status:** The current state of the smart contract (e.g., Success, In Review, Pending or Failed).
    
-   **Network:** The blockchain network on which the smart contract operates, i.e. Testnet.
    
-   **Created on:** The date when the smart contract was created.
    

2**. Tools & Filters**

![Figure 3: Tools & Filters](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060006867280%2Foriginal%2FaqLbtUziuzoiRn7w7JCr1yypqqHuYBmAyQ.png%3F1708077542&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=c7168e23f0da47686410fc8ad3cd169ef4198acd72042b171c880d1d763a6e9c)



-   **Select Network:** This dropdown allows you to filter the list of smart contracts by the blockchain network they operate on. The network can be a test network.
    
-   **Select Status:** This dropdown lets you filter the smart contracts based on their current status. Options might include _Success, In Review, Pending, or Failed_ helping you to find contracts that match your criteria for operational status.
    
-   **Date:** This filter allows you to select smart contracts based on their creation date or any significant date markers relevant to the contract's lifecycle. You can often choose from a date range picker to view contracts created.
    

**Additional Scenarios (When the user clicks on the edit button)** When you click the edit icon in the Smart Contract Details, you'll be able to edit the following fields:

![Figure 4: Edit Icon](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060006927700%2Foriginal%2FDD8O3sarzt0tgt-iOGBeZGXa7bh_ZlsOvA.png%3F1708324230&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=7b8c9d1da7b9265ba1c4a006777cd208b2d67df0972d5dd4ba2a55a12b9c0ade)



> A user will only be able to use the edit icon when the smart contract is saved in drafts.

1. On selecting the edit icon against any contract, the all details present in the drafts can be changed.

2. If the status is set to success, pending or in review, the user can change only the name and description.

-   **Smart Contract Name:** Allows you to update the name of the smart contract.
    
-   **Project Name:** Enables you to change the project or initiative the smart contract is associated with.
    
-   **Network:** It lets you select or change the blockchain network on which the smart contract operates i.e. test network
    
-   **Environment:** You can update the environment setting of the smart contract Development, Staging, and Production.
    
-   **Description:** Provides a text area where you can edit or add a detailed description of the smart contractâ€™s purpose and functionality.
    

![Figure5: Edit Smart Contract](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060006927895%2Foriginal%2F-Yo_fjfFUKmKL6M1ZGbr3MJA4TkPE_kTyg.png%3F1708324445&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=17ade7780cfbda4a9e13e9e0476854991c593ee87200a5d72255dfde4af4fb5e)



When you select a deployed smart contract (with a success status) from the list, you'll be presented with the **Smart Contract Details** section where you can gain details on your selected Smart Contract.

**3. Gain Details**

For more details regarding a particular Smart Contract, you can click on the smart contract details and you'll get a screen where you can change tabs between details, Transactions, and API Endpoints of the Smart Contract.

![Figure 6: Smart Contract Details](https://docs.kalp.studio/~gitbook/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-south-1.amazonaws.com%2Find-cdn.freshdesk.com%2Fdata%2Fhelpdesk%2Fattachments%2Fproduction%2F1060006928131%2Foriginal%2F0ryDit9vBGiZiFS459YWRr0LPbnSPh6K_A.png%3F1708324758&width=768&dpr=4&quality=100&sign=18fa738fe71b740d0d2ef06596915e3d1bda1ad538263909be362f03bfd0de61)
