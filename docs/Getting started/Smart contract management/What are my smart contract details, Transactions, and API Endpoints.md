# What are my Smart Contract Details, Transactions, and API Endpoints?

Hey Users! Welcome to the Kalp Studio Platform.

Smart contracts might sound complex, but understanding their transactions and endpoints doesn't have to be intimidating. Ever wondered how to check a contract's details, explore its history, or interact with its functionalities? You've come to the right place!

This guide will break down the world of smart contracts, making their transactions and endpoints clear and accessible. We'll take you on a journey to unlock the mysteries and empower you to confidently navigate this exciting realm.

**Step 1:** Go to **Dashboard** or go to the smart contract section on the left menu. For details regarding a particular Smart Contract, you can click on the smart contract details and you'll get a screen where you can change tabs between details, Transactions, and API Endpoints of the Smart Contract.

**1. Smart Contract Details** The "Smart Contract Details" provide specific information about a particular smart contract in a Kalp network.

-   **ID:** A blank field where the unique identifier of the smart contract will be displayed.
    
-   **Environment:** The stage of deployment, such as development, staging, and production.
    
-   **Network:** Specifies on which net the smart contract is deployed i.e. testing.
    
-   **Project:** The name or identifier of the project associated with the smart contract.
    
-   **Created On:** The date and time the smart contract was created.
    
-   **Description:** A brief description of the smart contract's purpose and functionality.
    

This form is used to input or modify details about a smart contract.

**2. Transaction**

This section displays the transaction-related information for the smart contract.

-   **ID:** Each transaction may be assigned a unique identifier for reference.
    
-   **Block ID:** The ID of the blockchain block that contains the transaction, useful for locating it within the Kalp.
    
-   **TxHash (Transaction Hash):** A unique alphanumeric string that identifies each transaction. It can be used to track and verify the transaction details on the Kalp.
    
-   **Created On:** The date and time when the transaction was recorded on the blockchain.
    
-   **Status:** Shows the current state of the transaction, such as pending, success, or failed.

These details help users audit the activity of a smart contract, tracking its use and the movement of assets or data it manages.

**3. API Endpoint**

The "API Endpoint" tab within a smart contract interface provides developers with access to the web API endpoints associated with a specific smart contract.

-   **API Endpoint URL:** The base URL for making API requests to interact with the smart contract.
    
-   **Smart Contract Address:** The unique address of the smart contract on the blockchain.
    
-   **Environment:** Specifies whether the smart contract is in a development, staging, and production environment.
    
-   **Network:** The blockchain network where the smart contract is deployed i.e. Test Net.

The list of operations includes:

-   **HTTP Method:** The type of request ( POST) used to interact with the API.
    
-   **Function:** The action or function that the API endpoint will perform.
    
-   **Route:** The specific path appended to the base URL to access a particular function or resource.
    
-   **Check Params:** A feature to validate the parameters for the API request, ensuring they meet the required format or data type before sending the request. 

This tab is essential for developers to test and ensure that their applications can communicate correctly with the smart contract through the API. Hope this article helped with beginning your journey to navigate Smart Contract details along with Transactions and Endpoints.
